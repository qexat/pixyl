Pixyl is a terminal-based frame render "engine".

> ‚ö†Ô∏è uhhh it's unfinished software but it kind of works ig

## Try it

First, clone this repository locally, and `cd` into `pixyl`.

Then, run:

```sh
pip install -e .
pixyl examples/test.pxsf
```

## F.A.Q

### Where does the name come from?

It's like "pixel" but the "e" became an "y" so there is "py" (for python) in it.\
Originally I wanted to go with Pixy because I really like [this k-pop group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpp_PErKkdQ)
but it's better with an ending "l" imo

### How does it work?

The concept is pretty simple, it plays with ANSI and the box character `‚ñÄ` basically

### What does PXSF stand for?

`PXSF` stands for **P**i**X**yl **S**equence **F**ormat üòé

### How does it look like?

(uhhh this section is outdated)

ah you're too lazy to try by yourself lol
