# Pixyl

Pixyl is a terminal-based frame render "engine".\
Dependencies: currently zero üòé (except `python3.11`)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è uhhh it's unfinished software but it kind of works ig

## Try it

First, clone this repository locally, and `cd` into `pixyl`.

Then, run:

```sh
pip install -e .
pixyl playground examples/test2.afs
```

## F.A.Q

### Where does the name come from?

It's like "pixel" but the "e" became an "y" so there is "py" (for python) in it.\
Originally I wanted to go with Pixy because I really like [this k-pop group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpp_PErKkdQ)
but it's better with an ending "l" imo

### How does it work?

The concept is pretty simple, it plays with ANSI and the box character `‚ñÄ` basically

### What is `test.afs` and what does AFS stand for?

`test.afs` is the file used in the playground.\
`AFS` stands for ANSI Frame Sequence I think, I don't remember what I made up lmao

### How does it look like?

ah you're too lazy to try by yourself lol\
ignore the flickering lmao it's just my recording software tripping
